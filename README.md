Currently in a playble state !
# Gameuh.py
A python rewrite of my favourite University project, a small incremental dungeon crawler.

Instead, it's now a looter bullet hell. Yeah
# TODO list

* ~~Adding jewels to the loot pools~~ Done !
* Rewrite the spellbook page, adding data about cooldown, costs, projectiles ...

* Adding at least two bosses (Wave boss and unique boss)
* Adding more options in the options menu (gamma, color correction, etc)
* Real saving system
* Adding general content
* Deciding on a art style and theme (thinking of going for Mechas ?)
* Sounds and musics ?
* Lore and story mode ?
* More game modes (boss rush, rogue like infinite waves, dungeons ?)

# Launching the game
You can clone the repo and compile it yourself, either by compiling and launching the launcher in `wrapper/`, or simply calling python from your own system or a virtual env.

You can also download the releases version; Linux version assumes you already have up-to-date `git` and `python3` installation. Windows version comes with a prepackaged git and python. Due to using pygame, you must have a python 3.12 installation for it to work.
