# Gameuh.py
A python rewrite of my favourite University project, a small incremental dungeon crawler.

# Launching the game
You can clone the repo and compile it yourself, either by compiling and launching the launcher in `wrapper/`, or simply calling python from your own system or a virtual env.

You can also download the releases version; Linux version assumes you already have up-to-date `git` and `python3` installation. Windows version comes with a prepackaged git and python. Due to using pygame, you must have a python 3.12 installation for it to work.
